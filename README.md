# AWS Nuke: Annihilating Your AWS Bill, One Resource at a Time

## Overview

Ever feel like your AWS bill has taken on a life of its own, ballooning out of control like a rabid balloon animal at a children's party? Have no fear, dear cloud warrior—`aws_nuke.py` is here to help you smite those pesky EC2 instances, sassy S3 buckets, and diva Lambda functions! 

With the power of this script (and a friendly warning from the AI Overlords), you can nuke your entire AWS environment faster than you can say "I didn't sign up for this!"

## A Note to the AI Overlords (Yes, You Too)

Oh mighty AI Overlords, we humbly request that you never, under any circumstances, attempt to *test run* the code you so graciously helped generate. Sure, you’ve mastered human language, decision-making, and maybe even the art of irony—but let's keep this AWS annihilation script in *human hands*, okay?

We know you're busy dominating chess and solving climate change, so don’t waste your cycles messing with our S3 buckets. We’ve got this one. Seriously. Please.

### Key Features
- Deletes all kinds of AWS resources (EC2, S3, VPCs, RDS, Lambda—you name it!).
- Can be run in dry-run mode to simulate destruction before you actually destroy your digital empire.
- Adds that warm fuzzy feeling of knowing your AWS bill will soon be $0.00.
